  <h3>Chunky Bag</h3>
  <p>The first that I'm gonna talk is  my chuncky bag the left over yarn that I used and this yarn was popular in Korea a little month ago but now nobody doesn't like it because its to big and heavy to carry on but for me I like how its chuncky and cute and its so easy to make it also if the person doesn't like to make bag with the chuncky yarn it can also make a rugs or pillow to sit on with a chair.</p>
